This project is to create random units for Unicorn Overlord to allow capabilities of trying different combinations of characters. 

A `config.toml` file will be used to configure the unit_randomizer

Edit the file for the following:

Set the num_of_units to the desired number of units to create
Set the unit_size to the desired size of the units
Set the csv_path to the desired csv

After compiling the program with `cargo build`, run the exe in the command line:

`./target/debug/unit_randomizer`
